# LAB_7

LAB_7 is a very handy tool used for the easy design and implementation of electronic circuits. The various features of this project are Filters, Logic Gates, Op-Amp Circuits, Oscillators, Number Conversion Systems, Capacitors, Digital Code Convertors, Adders and Subtractors and Rectifiers provide wide range of functionality. Each feature has its own set of inputs provided by the user in the command line and the output is displayed through the same.
